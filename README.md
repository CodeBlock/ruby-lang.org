**Work in progress**.

----

This repository is a gem-like Jekyll application for http://www.ruby-lang.org.

This is the "official" port, created by current contributors to ruby-lang.org. Obviousy, other projects are welcomed, but eventually, there should be only one central ("official") website for Ruby, along other community-based resources such as RubySource, Ruby Insideâ€¦ Eventually, Matz will decide if people are not able to agree.

----

This application is based around a Jekyll instance, but makes use of several other libraries and hand-made tools, to ease maintenance and deploy.
Goals:

* maintenance of ruby-lang.org through Github (this repos)
* free page edition through pull requests
* easy translations synchronization thx to the git workflow
* a brand new content, hopefully maintained up-to-date thx to the git workflow
* a set of tools for mainteners (deploy etc.)
